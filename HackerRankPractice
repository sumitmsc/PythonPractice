'''IMPORTANT RULE FROM THE PROBLEM (critical nuance)

A word is considered leet ONLY IF:

✔ It contains at least one letter
✔ AND at least one leet symbol/digit from the mapping

(0 2 3 7 # @ $)

Words that contain only letters (A–Z) → NOT leet

Words that contain only digits or only symbols → NOT leet

Words like H3ll0, W0r7d, 3X@MP73 → leet

Words like HELLO, WORLD, INTEREST, MUSIC → NOT leet → return unchanged (just uppercase)
------------------------------------------------------------------
❗ Your earlier logic is incorrectly classifying some normal words as leet

This happens when the judge input has words like:

INTEREST TEXTURE ALARM ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code thinks they are leet (because alphabetic letters count), but they do not contain any leet symbols, so they must not be decoded.
-----------------------------------
100% Correct Logic To Detect a Leet Word

A word is leet ONLY IF:

(contains at least one letter) AND (contains at least one leet symbol from mapping)
-----------------------------------------------
0, 2, 3, 7, #, @, $

Let’s implement exactly that.
